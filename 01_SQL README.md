### ðŸ’»Tools Used
- Ms Excel (for Data Analysis cleaning)
    - For data collection
    - For data cleaning
- SQL Server ( for Querying and Analysis)
- Ms power point (for Presentation)

### ðŸ“Œ Data cleaning and preparation
1. Data Loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variable
3. Data cleaning and formating
4. Data filtering

### ðŸ“Ÿ Project Objectives
1. Which product category had the highest sales? 
2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales? 
3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?

## ðŸ“˜Summary
The SQL query analysis revealed key insights into sales distribution across categories, regions, shipping methods, and customer value. The Technology category emerged as the top-performing segment with total sales of 4,739,149. Regionally, Ontario led in sales figures, followed closely by the Prairie and Atlantic regions. In contrast, Nunavut recorded the lowest sales, followed by the Northwest Territory and Yukon.
In terms of logistics, the most commonly used shipping mode was delivery truck, indicating a preference Or low Cost in this method. Additionally, the data showed that the most valuable customer made purchases predominantly in the Technology category.
