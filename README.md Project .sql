---11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and 
Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer---

 select ship_mode,order_priority,  sum(shipping_cost) as cost
 from  KMS_inventory
 group by ship_mode,order_priority
 order by cost desc

 --- To interpret this, we need to understand what each order priority stands for
 Critical: This piority requires highest urgency, which require immediate action
 High: A high piority requiresprompt processing, but not as as urgent critical order . it needs to be attended to meet up customers needs
 Medium : orders are important, but not urgent , can be deliver within the timeframe
 Low : they are least important and can be, they can be processed at later time
 Not specified: No specific priority was specify.

 With this understanding we have an idea on our order priority 
 ---- From the analysis its clearly shows
 Appropriate use of delivery cost is economical because it helps to reduce the shipping cost but its not appropriate for critical and high order priority, its efficient for low , medium and non specified orders.
Delay in critical and high order priority may lead to loss of high influential customers, loss of trust from both current customers and potential customers.
In case of emergency truck delivery should not be considered for critical and high to avoid violation and penalties
Truck deliveries are prone and have high rate of defect items which might not be idea or critical and high order priority.
Kultra Mega Stores  is spending shipping cost appropriately low order priority but not spending it appropriately with high and critical order priority.
Express air shipping mode stands appropriate for high and critical priority order to avoid losing of customer due to delay in delivery.
