 ## 📜 Conclusion on Retail Tech Product Review Insight
 
The dashboard presents a comprehensive view of pricing, discount behavior, customer reviews, and product performance across categories. 

- Here are the key takeaways:
  * Electronics, Home & Kitchen, and Computers & Accessories dominate in product count, pricing, and customer engagement.
 * There's a clear positive correlation between discounts and sales, indicating that discounts effectively drive purchases.
* Customer ratings are generally favorable (mostly between 3.8 and 4.5), with top-rated categories showing higher engagement and product performance.

## 📌Recommendations
1. Maximize Strategic Discounting
Focus higher discounts (50%+) on low-performing product.
2. Maintain moderate discounts (20–40%) for high-performing categories to retain perceived value.
3. Invest More in High-Rated Categories
4. Scale efforts in Electronics and Computers with high ratings and review volume, as these show customer satisfaction and trust.
5. Improve Product Ratings in Low-Scoring Categories
6. Investigate categories like Health & Personal Care and Car Accessories where ratings or review volumes are low.
7. Use feedback to improve product quality or customer experience.
8. Enhance Review Collection Efforts
  - Encourage customers to leave reviews across underrepresented categories.
  - Use incentives or follow-up emails to boost review counts for data-driven decisions.
