  Tasks focus on pricing, ratings, discount patterns, and category insights
  
  ### üíªTools Used
- Ms Excel (for Data Analysis cleaning)
  - For data collection
  - For data cleaning
- Pivot Table and chart (for analysis and Dashboard Visualization)


### üîçData cleaning and preparation
- Data Loading and inspection
- Handling missing variable
- Data cleaning and formating
- Data filtering
- Removing duplicates values

### üè£Data Manipulation 

* The Category column was split using a delimiter to enhance clarity and support more granular analysis.

####üìä New Calculated Columns Created

1. Average Discount Percentage
= (Actual Price - Discounted Price) / Actual Price * 100
2. Potential Revenue
= Actual Price * Rating Count
3. Discount Flag (‚â•50%)
= IF(Discount % >= 50, "Yes", "No")
4. Unique Products
= IF(Discounted Price <= 500, "‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500", ">‚Çπ500")
Discount Bucket
= IF([@Discount%]<=10, "0‚Äì10%", 
  IF([@Discount%]<=20, "11‚Äì20%", 
  IF([@Discount%]<=30, "21‚Äì30%", ...)))
Product Review 
= IF(Rating Count < 1000, "Fewer than 1000", "Greater than")
Scaling Factor Calculation
= Average Rating + (Rating Count / 1000)
  
### üìãAnalysis Tasks
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price √ó rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <‚Çπ200,‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500, >‚Çπ500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.

 ## üìú Conclusion on Retail Tech Product Review Insight
 
The dashboard presents a comprehensive view of pricing, discount behavior, customer reviews, and product performance across categories. 

- Here are the key takeaways:
  * Electronics, Home & Kitchen, and Computers & Accessories dominate in product count, pricing, and customer engagement.
 * There's a clear positive correlation between discounts and sales, indicating that discounts effectively drive purchases.
* Customer ratings are generally favorable (mostly between 3.8 and 4.5), with top-rated categories showing higher engagement and product performance.
* Despite significant discounting, some categories still maintain high average prices, showing product value and brand strength.

## üìåRecommendations
1. Maximize Strategic Discounting
Focus higher discounts (50%+) on low-performing product.
2. Maintain moderate discounts (20‚Äì40%) for high-performing categories to retain perceived value.
3. Invest More in High-Rated Categories
4. Scale efforts in Electronics and Computers with high ratings and review volume, as these show customer satisfaction and trust.
5. Improve Product Ratings in Low-Scoring Categories
6. Investigate categories like Health & Personal Care and Car Accessories where ratings or review volumes are low.
7. Use feedback to improve product quality or customer experience.
8. Enhance Review Collection Efforts
  - Encourage customers to leave reviews across underrepresented categories.
  - Use incentives or follow-up emails to boost review counts for data-driven decisions.
